\section*{Abstract}
The Language Workbench Competition 2011 (LWC11) is an initiative created by a
group of experts at the CodeGeneration 2010
conference\footnote{\url{http://www.codegeneration.net/cg2010/}}. The aim is to
set a common task\footnote{see \url{http://www.languageworkbenches.net/} for the
detailed description of the LWC11 competition and other submissions}
for Language Workbenches\footnote{\url{http://martinfowler.com/articles/languageWorkbench.html},
\url{http://blog.efftinge.de/2007/11/definition-of-term-language-workbench.html}}
which is implemented with the different existing alternatives in a comparable
way. This document describes in detail how the task is solved with
Xtext\footnote{\url{http://www.xtext.org}}. Xtext is one of the most well known
Language Workbenches and part of the Eclipse Modeling
Project\footnote{\url{http://www.eclipse.org/modeling}}.
