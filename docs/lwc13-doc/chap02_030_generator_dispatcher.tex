\subsubsection {Dispatcher template}
\label{sec:dispatcherTemplate}

The code generator is invoked with a \texttt{Resource} instance, which holds a \texttt{Questionnaire}
instance. We have to generate multiple artifacts for each resource, so it is a common 
pattern to create a template class which serves as entry point and dispatches to other
template classes to create the artifacts. Usually one template per artifact is
created.

Create the class \texttt{Root.java} in 
package \texttt{org.eclipse.xtext.example.ql.generator}:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Java]
package org.eclipse.xtext.example.ql.generator;

import javax.inject.Inject;

import org.eclipse.emf.ecore.resource.Resource;
import org.eclipse.xtext.generator.IFileSystemAccess;
import org.eclipse.xtext.generator.IGenerator;
import org.eclipse.xtext.xbase.compiler.JvmModelGenerator;

@SuppressWarnings("restriction")
public class Root implements IGenerator {
  @Inject
  JvmModelGenerator jvmModelGenerator;

  public void doGenerate(Resource input, IFileSystemAccess fsa) {
    // dispatch to other generators
    jvmModelGenerator.doGenerate(input, fsa);
  }
}
\end{lstlisting}

As a first generator to which is dispatched, we inject an instance of
\texttt{JvmModelGenerator}. This is a standard generator shipped with Xtext which
translates types inferred by the Jvm Model Inferrer to Java classes.
In our case, the Java class for Forms are generated by the
\texttt{JvmModelGenerator}. In JSF terms, we speek of the \emph{Backing Bean}.
 
Next, Xtext has to know that \texttt{Root} is the template that has to be invoked
as generator implementation. This has to be configured - you guessed right! - 
with Guice again. We need to add a configuration that binds the \texttt{IGenerator}
interface to the \texttt{Root} class.

Open class \texttt{QlDslRuntimeModule} and add this method:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Java]
  @Override
  public Class<? extends IGenerator> bindIGenerator() {
    return Root.class;
  }
\end{lstlisting}

Now we are ready to add additional templates and register them in the
\texttt{Root} class.
