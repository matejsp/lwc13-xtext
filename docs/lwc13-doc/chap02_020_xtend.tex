\subsection{Xtend}

Since we will use Xtend to write the code generator, this chapter describes some
basic concepts of the Xtend language. However, we will not cover all aspects of
Xtend in this section, for more information see also the official documentation\footnote{\url{http://www.eclipse.org/xtend/documentation.html}}.

Xtend is a statically-typed general purpose language similar to Java. Xtend uses
Xbase as core language which was already roughly explained in section \ref{sec:Xbase}.
The main focus of Xtend lies in providing a language which seamlessly plays together with 
Java 

- uses xbase as core

- small method: explain def, val, var, everything is an expression, implicit return type
- extension methods
- polymorphic dispatching

- loops (for with separator)
- switch case based on type
- rich strings
