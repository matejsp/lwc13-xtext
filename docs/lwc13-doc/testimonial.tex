\section*{Testimonial}
This project was developed with the help of some colleagues at itemis, and I am
grateful for their help:

\begin{compactenum}
  \item \emph{Sven Efftinge} contributed the Instance DSL. Without his knowledge
  it would be very hard to implement this project already with Xtext 2.0 in this
  pre-release state.
  \item \emph{Rainer Klute} has written the initial version of the introduction.
  Although at that time the task was realized with Xtext 1.0.2 and many places
  have been reworked, major parts of the Overview and Phase 0.1 descriptions are
  based on his contribution.
  \item \emph{Karsten Nolte and Alexander Hannweg} initially transformed the
  Wiki pages to LaTeX.
  \item \emph{The Xtext Development Team} was always responsive for questions
  , provided with the Domainmodel example a good template to create major parts
  of the implementation and was eager to fix detected bugs.
  \item Detailed feedback helped to improve the document. My thanks for
  reading the document carefully and providing input go to
