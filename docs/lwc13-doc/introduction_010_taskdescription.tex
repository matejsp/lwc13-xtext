\subsection{Task Description}
The {\href{http://www.languageworkbenches.net/images/5/53/Ql.pdf}{LWC13 task}}
is to implement a DSL for questionnaires (Questionnaire Language, QL), which
basically allows the definition of forms with questions.


\subsection{Technology Stack}
This tutorial expects that you are somehow familiar with Java and Eclipse and
have heard about \url{EMF} and how it works in general before. We start almost at the
beginning, but not quite :-) 

We will use Xtext 2.3.1, which is at the moment of writing the latest official
release.
Xtext 2.4 is in preparation and will be released with Eclipse Kepler in June
2013\footnote{\url{http://wiki.eclipse.org/Kepler/Simultaneous_Release_Plan}}.
The solution approach described here would work also with any version
of Xtext >= 2.0, but the API might differ slightly, so there is no guarantee
that each codeline printed here would work exactly with all versions. For better
reproduction it is highly recommended to use the versions mentioned above.

For Code Generation we will use the language Xtend, which itself is based on
Xtext. Xtend makes use of a common expression language shipped with Xtext called
Xbase. The languages developped here will also be based on Xbase, but more on
this later.
