\subsection{Code Generator}

In this section you will learn how to implement the code generator for 
the target application. For simplicity, the code generator templates are placed
in the \texttt{org.eclipse.xtext.example.ql} project in a sub-package \texttt{generator}. 
Usually it would be better to create a separate project which contains the generator,
since the language is independent from a single target platform. It would
be possible to create different code generators for different target platforms,
and it would be better to implement each of them as separate projects.

Generator templates in Xtend are implementations of the \texttt{IGenerator}
interface:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Java]
package org.eclipse.xtext.generator;

public interface IGenerator {
	/**
	 * @param input - the input for which to generate resources
	 * @param fsa - file system access to be used to generate files
	 */
	public void doGenerate(Resource input, IFileSystemAccess fsa);
}
\end{lstlisting}
